#Step 1 - How does pong work?
#1 - receive image frame
#2 - move paddle UP/DOWN? (binary)
#3 - Make action recieve reward (+1 if moves past AI, -1 if missed ball, 0 otherwise)
#lets forget about other pong details. focus on the algo.

#Step 2 - On RL
#1 RL is a Branch of machine learning concerned with taking #sequences of actions
#Usually described in terms of agent interacting with a
#previously unknown environment, trying to maximize cumulative reward
#2 RL combined with other techniques is powerful (AlphaGo, DQN)
#Policy Gradients > DQN (by most ppl, incl. DQN Authors) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RfOCYIL8k
#3 we'll build a 2 layer fully connected neural network
#https://karpathy.github.io/assets/rl/policy.png
#recieves image pixels, outputs probability of moving UP (stochasticity!)

#Step 3  Policy gradients have 3 key differences from supervised learning
#1 We dont have the correct labels so as a fake label we substitute the action we happened to sample from the policy 
#2 We modulate the loss for each example multiplicatively based on the eventual outcome
#since we want to increase the log probability for actions that worked and decrease it for those that didnt. 
#3 runs on a continuously changing dataset (the episodes), scaled by the advantage, and we only want to do one (or very few) 
#updates based on each sampled dataset.
#4 can be used to backprop when nodes are stochastic (!!, more on this later)

#Step 4 - PG vs Humans
#Policy Gradients have to actually experience a positive reward, and experience it very often in order to eventually and slowly shift the policy parameters towards 
#repeating moves that give high rewards. With our abstract model, humans can figure out what is likely to give rewards without ever actually experiencing the 
#rewarding or unrewarding transition. I dont have to actually experience crashing my car into a wall a few hundred times before I slowly start avoiding to do so.

#Step 5 - Credit Assignment problem
#Credit assignment problem - we just got +1 reward. what caused it? millions parameters and pixels...which frame? 
#no labels!
#https://karpathy.github.io/assets/rl/rl.png
#forward pass > output probability distribution > sample from it to take an action > wait for reward > use reward as gradient
#to update network via backprop
#reward could be any positive number. doesnt matter. its about magnitude. thanks neural nets.
